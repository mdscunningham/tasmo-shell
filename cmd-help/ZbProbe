ZbProbe

<device>= probe a Zigbee device to get additional information including its IEEEaddress, vendor and model names, endpoints, and supported clusters per endpoint.
Device probe is performed automatically when a new Zigbee device connects.
Battery powered Zigbee devices can not be probed in general because they are usually in sleep mode.
