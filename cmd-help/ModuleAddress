ModuleAddress

Set the address of a PZEM module
1..3 = the last octet of the PZEM-004T serial address
<address> = the last octet of the address on MODBUS PZEM energy monitoring modules
Prior to setting the module address, the PZEM must be connected to both RX and TX, and AC voltage.
Connect one PZEM at a time and issue this command. Repeat for each PZEM to be connected for multi-phase monitoring.
The command without an argument cannot be used to read the address of the connected PZEM.
