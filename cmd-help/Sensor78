EZO sensors - commands
Ascii commands are sent directly to the sensor as-is. See your specific EZO device datasheet for the list of commands available.
By default, the specific command is sent to all EZO devices that are found. If using multiple EZO sensors, and the command should be issued to a single device, the index can be specified as part of the command: Sensor78-# where # represent the index of the device (ex: Sensor78-1 i). For more details please see Tasmota's support for EZO devices.
