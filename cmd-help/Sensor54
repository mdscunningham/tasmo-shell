INA226 Current Sensor
1 = rescan for devices and return the number found.
2 = save the configuration and restart
10 = return channel 1 shunt resistance, full scale current and full scale voltage
11 <resistance> = set INA226 channel 1 shunt in ohms, floating point
12 <current> = set INA226 channel 1 full scale in amperes, floating point
13 <voltage> = set INA226 channel 1 full scale in volts, floating point (defaults to 40.96v, not persistent, must be set at boot)
20 = return channel 2 shunt resistance and full scale current
21 <resistance> = set INA226 channel 2 shunt in ohms, floating point
22 <current> = set INA226 channel 2 full scale in amperes, floating point
23 <voltage> = set INA226 channel 2 full scale in volts, floating point (defaults to 40.96v, not persistent, must be set at boot)
30 = return channel 3 shunt resistance and full scale current
31 <resistance> = set INA226 channel 1 shunt in ohms, floating point
32 <current> = set INA226 channel 3 full scale in amperes, floating point
33 <voltage> = set INA226 channel 3 full scale in volts, floating point (defaults to 40.96v, not persistent, must be set at boot)
40 = return channel 4 shunt resistance and full scale current
41 <resistance> = set INA226 channel 1 shunt in ohms, floating point
42 <current> = set INA226 channel 4 full scale in amperes, floating point
43 <voltage> = set INA226 channel 4 full scale in volts, floating point (defaults to 40.96v, not persistent, must be set at boot)
