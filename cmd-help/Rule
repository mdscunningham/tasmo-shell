Rule set one-shot: Each rule within the rule set will trigger only once until the trigger condition returns to a false condition. For example, ON Energy#Power<3: Without one-shot enabled, it will trigger anytime Energy#Power gets an update (i.e., the Power telemetry value changes) and the value is <3. This can potentially trigger that rule multiple times. With one-shot enabled, the rule will trigger only the on the first transition to <3 and not again until the trigger value goes >=3. In other words, the rule will trigger again, but it has to cross the conditional ""boundary"" before it will trigger again.
