ShutterMode

1..7 (default = 1)
Defines the mode the shutter will operates the relays, steppers and/or servos. 6=autodetect based on INTERLOCK and GPIO defined. STATUS 13 show the mode.
1 = normal two relay up/off down/off
2 = two relay on/off up/down. Must be set manually
3 = one relay garage mode
4 = one relay plus stepper motor
5 = one relay and position servo
6 = one relay and PWM servo speed controlled by PWM. Position time based
7 = autodetect (once) based on existance of GPIO definition.
