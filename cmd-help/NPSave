write data permanently into EEPROM.
During the EEPROM write procedure the NeoPool device may be unresponsive to MODBUS requests, this process always takes less than 1 second.
Since this process is limited by the number of EEPROM write cycles, it is recommend to write all necessary changes to the registers and only then execute EEPROM write process using this command.
Note: The number of EEPROM writes for Sugar Valley NeoPool devices is guaranteed 100,000 cycles. As soon as this number is exceeded, further storage of information can no longer be guaranteed.
