INA219 and ISL28022 low voltage current sensor configuration
Predefined modes to use with standard 0.1 ohm resistor:
0 = set INA219 calibration to max 32V and 2A
1 = set INA219 calibration to max 32V and 1A
2 = set INA219 calibration to max 16V and 0.4A
In all cases, ISL28022 is set to 60V mode
10..255: Define custom shunt resistor encoded as a decimal number RRM such that Rshunt = RR * 10^M milliohm
Do not forget to choose a resistor adapted for the correct power dissipation and apply a 50% security margin !
Examples:
11 = 1 * 10^1 = 10 milliohm (Imax=32A => Pres=15W)
21 = 2 * 10^1 = 20 milliohm (Imax=16A => Pres=7W)
12 = 1 * 10^2 = 100 milliohm (default, Imax=3.2A => Pres=2W)
13 = 1 * 10^3 = 1000 milliohm = 1 ohm (Imax=0.320A => Pres=0,2W)
The driver seamlessly detect INA219/ISL28022 and adapt configuration and readings accordingly. The component label in Web GUI and SENSOR message will automatically match the detected part.
It is possible to mix INA219 and ISL28022 as far as addresses do not conflicts.
Shunt resistor setting applies to all INA219/ISL28022.
