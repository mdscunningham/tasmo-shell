ZbModelId

Manually force the ModelId field of a Zigbee device. This is used to simulate devices not physically present on the network, for debugging only.
<device>,<modelid> = set new ModelId
<device>, = (empty ModelId) clear ModelId
<device> = display current ModelId (also displayed in ZbStatus2)
