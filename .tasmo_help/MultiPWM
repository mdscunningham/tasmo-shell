MultiPWM
SetOption68

Multi-channel PWM instead of a single light
0 = Treat PWM as a single light (default)
1 = Treat PWM as separate channels. In this mode, use Power<x> to turn lights on and off, and Channel<x> to change the value of each channel.
Color still works to set all channels at once.
Requires restart after change
