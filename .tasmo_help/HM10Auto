HM10Auto 

<value> = start an automatic discovery scan with an interval of <value> seconds to receive data in BLE advertisements periodically.
This is an active scan and it should be used only if necessary. At the moment that is the case just with MJ_HT_V1. This can change if a future HM-10 firmware starts supporting passive scan.
