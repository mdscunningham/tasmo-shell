SetOption134

PWM force phases to be synced (ESP32 only).
On ESP32, PWM phases are by default distributed one after the other to minimize effect on power supply. This is also mandatory for H-Bridge devices.
0 = phases are automatically aligned one after the other, 1 = phases all start at the same time (default behavior for ESP8266).
