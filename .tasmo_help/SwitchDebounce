SwitchDebounce

User control over switch debounce timing and method
40..1000 = set switch debounce time in milliseconds (default = 50). The granularity is 10 milliseconds, so the normally unnecessary last digit is used by the debouncing code to flag special handling: 
0 = no special handling 
1 = force_high: only a debounce time long LOW pulse could turn the switch off 
2 = force_low: only a debounce time long HIGH pulse could turn the switch on 
3 = force_high + force_low 
4..8 = unused 
9 = AC detection for switches / relays similar to MOES MS-104B / BlitzWolf SS5 etc. If the AC frequency is 50 Hz, SwitchDebounce 69 will turn on the switch after three pulses and off after three missing one.
