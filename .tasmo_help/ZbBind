ZbBind

Binds one Zigbee device to another device or to a group. This allows one device to directly send commands (f.e. a remote to a bulb) without any action on the coordinator.
Command structure: {""Device"":""<device>"", ""Endpoint"":<endpoint>, ""Cluster"":<cluster>, ""ToDevice"":""<to_device>"", ""ToEndpoint"":<to_endpoint>, ""ToGroup"":<to_group> }
<device> = device sending messages (mandatory)
<endpoint> = source endpoint (mandatory)
<cluster> = source cluster id (mandatory)
<to_device> = target device (optional)
<to_endpoint> = target endpoint
 (optional if it can be inferred from ZbStatus3)
<to_group> = target group id (optional)
You must specify either ""ToDevice"" or ""ToGroup"" but not both
Zigbee2Tasmota must know the IEEE address of target device, see ZbStatus2 to verify and ZbProbe to have Zigbee2Tasmota query the address
(EZSP ZBBridge only) If you bind devices to groups you should also use ZbListen to that group, otherwise MQTT messages will not be published
